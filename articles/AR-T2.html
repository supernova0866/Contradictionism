<h1>The Art of Becoming: A Thesis on Change, Suffering, Comfort, and Ethical Growth</h1>

<p class="drop-cap">This thesis argues that the purpose of human life is not the attainment of perfection, but the continuous pursuit of becoming more perfected than one currently is. Reality, identity, and meaning are defined not by static states but by change and development. Suffering and comfort are not inherently good or bad; rather, they function as tools that reveal human limits and character. True growth depends on the conscious use of both suffering and comfort to cultivate learning, discipline, and ethical ambition. Completion and perfection are illusions of perspective, while flaws and incompleteness constitute the foundation of beauty and existence.</p>

<h2>I. Introduction: The Illusion of Completion</h2>

<p>Human societies often frame life as a journey toward completion: success, fulfillment, or perfection. However, such concepts assume that a final state of being is achievable. This thesis rejects that assumption. A “healthy stopping point” implies that one can reach a state where no further growth is necessary. Yet this contradicts the observable nature of human life: individuals are always changing physically, mentally, and morally.</p>

<p>Thus, the goal of life is not to become perfect, but to become more perfect than one was before. Growth is not an endpoint but a continuous motion. Hunger for improvement is essential to existence, though it must be governed by discipline and ethical boundaries.</p>

<h2>II. Reality and Identity as Change</h2>

<p>Reality is not defined by permanence, but by transformation. A person is real insofar as they participate in change. Identity is not a fixed object but a process of becoming shaped by time, experience, and reflection.</p>

<p>To say “this is who I am” is therefore incomplete. A more accurate statement is:</p>

<blockquote class="italic">“This is who I am becoming.”</blockquote>

<p>Completion is always relative. A person may be complete in reference to a moment or condition, but never in an absolute sense. There is no total completeness because there is no pure perfection. Flaws and limitations are not defects of existence but its essential structure. Without imperfection, there would be no direction for growth and no tension that produces meaning.</p>

<p>Thus, unfinishedness is not weakness. It is the highest form of being.</p>

<h2>III. Suffering as Knowledge, Not Strength</h2>

<p>The common belief that “suffering makes people stronger” is misleading. Suffering itself does not produce strength; it produces awareness of vulnerability. It reveals how different situations can break a person in different ways.</p>

<p>A person in constant suffering may learn how to recover, but this is not self-knowledge. It is survival knowledge. Strength emerges only when suffering is transformed into reflection and change. Two individuals may experience the same hardship, yet one becomes bitter and stagnant while the other becomes disciplined and resilient.</p>

<p>Therefore, suffering functions as information rather than virtue. It shows where the soul fractures, not how it should be built. Growth arises from what one chooses to do with that information.</p>

<div class="page-divider"></div>

<h2>IV. Comfort as Preparation or Decay</h2>

<p>Comfort is equally dangerous and equally powerful. It provides time for rest, reflection, and preparation. However, when misused, comfort becomes a slow form of suffering—one that is invisible.</p>

<p>Comfort that is not utilized for learning leads to stagnation. Rest becomes rot when a person stops seeking new knowledge and becomes content with who they are. Contentment can either be gratitude with curiosity or complacency disguised as peace.</p>

<p>A person in constant suffering may become strong but not self-aware. A person in constant comfort may feel peaceful but grow weak. True development requires tension between both states. Comfort must be used as a period of sharpening rather than dulling.</p>

<p>This can be expressed metaphorically:<br>
A rusted knife used to face hardship may still cut, but when used only for pleasure, it poisons its owner. Tools meant for resistance decay when devoted only to comfort.</p>

<div class="page-divider"></div>

<h2>V. Desire, Discipline, and Ethical Growth</h2>

<p>The hunger to achieve is not a flaw but a necessity of life. However, unchecked desire becomes destructive. The proper aim is not limitless wanting, but directed wanting.</p>

<p>Growth must be achieved through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal effort</li>
  <li>learning</li>
  <li>discipline</li>
  <li>honest means</li>
</ul>

<p>Underhanded methods corrupt the self rather than perfect it. A person who achieves more through unethical means does not become more perfected, only more powerful. The distinction between progress and corruption lies in how one attains what one seeks.</p>

<p>Thus, the ideal human stance is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>always wanting more</li>
  <li>never losing control of that want</li>
  <li>never abandoning moral effort</li>
</ul>

<p>This balance defines ethical ambition.</p>

<h2>VI. Beauty in Imperfection</h2>

<p>Perfection would imply stasis. A flawless being would have nowhere to go and nothing to improve. Such a being would lack narrative and tension. Beauty emerges from imperfection because imperfection allows transformation.</p>

<p>Art, identity, and existence itself are compelling precisely because they are unfinished. Completion is contextual, not absolute. Every state of being is only complete in relation to a specific moment in time.</p>

<p>Flaws generate direction.<br>
Unfinishedness generates meaning.</p>

<div class="page-divider"></div>

<h2>VII. Conclusion: The Art of Becoming</h2>

<p>The purpose of life is not to arrive at perfection but to advance toward a better version of oneself than existed before. Hunger for improvement must never be extinguished, yet it must never overwhelm the individual. Growth must be pursued through effort rather than deception, through reflection rather than complacency.</p>

<p>Human existence is defined by becoming, not by being. There is no final form, only continuous revision. A person remains real, alive, and meaningful as long as they continue to change.</p>

<p><strong>Reality is change.</strong><br>
<strong>Identity is unfinished.</strong><br>
<strong>Suffering teaches limits.</strong><br>
<strong>Comfort reveals character.</strong><br>
<strong>Desire fuels progress.</strong><br>
<strong>Discipline guides it.</strong></p>
