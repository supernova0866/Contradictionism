<h1>Reality as Change: A Thesis on Identity, Truth, and Becoming</h1>

<p>This thesis argues that “reality” is not defined by permanence or factual correctness, but by change and impact. A person, idea, or experience is real only insofar as it participates in transformation—within itself and within others. Life, identity, and meaning are therefore not static states but ongoing processes of becoming. Truth and falsehood are secondary to consequence, and existence without change collapses into irrelevance.</p>

<h2>I. Introduction: The Problem of “Real”</h2>

<p>The concept of what is “real” resists clear definition. Authenticity is often proposed as a measure of reality, yet authenticity itself depends on context and perception. If people continuously change based on environment, relationships, and experience, then a singular and fixed “real self” cannot exist.</p>

<blockquote>If something does not change, can it still be considered real?</blockquote>

<h2>II. Change as the Criterion of Reality</h2>

<p>Stagnation implies non-participation in life. That which does not evolve, adapt, or interact becomes inert. A dead body, though physically present, is untouched and unmoved. It does not change with the world and therefore no longer participates in reality as a living force.</p>

<p>Reality is not defined by existence alone, but by relevance and interaction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>respond</li>
  <li>transform</li>
  <li>grow</li>
  <li>affect others</li>
</ul>

<p>A dead body remains the same, and thus gradually loses its place in lived reality. Grief exists because the relationship continues to change within the living, not because the body itself does.</p>

  Existence ≠ Reality<br>
  Reality = that which changes and matters
</p>

<h2>III. Identity as Process, Not Object</h2>

<p>If reality is change, then identity cannot be fixed.</p>

<p>A person is not a single stable self but a sequence of versions shaped by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>different relationships</li>
  <li>different moments</li>
  <li>different emotional and physical conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>The self is not what remains constant, but what continues to transform. The claim “this is who I am” is always provisional.</p>

<p>A more accurate statement is:</p>

<blockquote class="italic">“This is who I am becoming right now.”</blockquote>

<p>Thus, a person is real only as long as they are unfinished.</p>

<h2>IV. Truth, Lies, and Consequence</h2>

<p>A contradiction appears when comparing truth and falsehood.</p>

<p>
  Telling someone “you will die” may be factually true but emotionally inert or harmful.<br>
  Telling someone “you will not die” may be false but emotionally transformative.
</p>

<p>This reveals that reality is not determined by correctness alone, but by effect.</p>

<p>
  To a healthy person, the lie may bring comfort.<br>
  To a dying person, the same lie becomes cruel.
</p>

<p>Thus, reality is relational and situational.</p>

<p>There is no universal emotional truth—only intersecting personal realities shaped by circumstance.</p>

<p>Reality is therefore not what is said, but what happens to a person as a result of what is said.</p>

<h2>V. Death as the Ultimate Example</h2>

<p>Death is repeatedly used as an example because it reveals reality under maximum pressure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>words gain weight</li>
  <li>truth and lies change meaning</li>
  <li>stagnation becomes visible</li>
</ul>

<p>Death marks the end of change. What remains is memory and influence within the living. The person continues to be “real” only insofar as they still transform the thoughts and emotions of others.</p>

<p>The self survives as motion inside other minds.</p>

<div class="page-divider"></div>

<h2>VI. Conclusion: Life as Becoming</h2>

<p>
  A person is alive as long as they change.<br>
  A person is real as long as they change.<br>
  And no person ever truly stops changing until death.
</p>

<p>Even stillness is a form of unnoticed change—aging, forgetting, adapting.</p>

<p><strong>Reality is not permanence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Identity is not a fixed core.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning is not stored in facts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reality is participation in time.</strong></p>

<p>The only constant self is the absence of a constant self.</p>

<p>To be real is to be unfinished.</p>
