<h1>Contradictionism Creed</h1>

<p>
I embrace paradox.<br>
I honor change.<br>
I hold no truth as absolute.<br>
I live in the tension between comfort and suffering,<br>
selfishness and cooperation,<br>
desire and discipline.<br>
</p>

<p>
I am unfinished.<br>
I am becoming.<br>
I am real, as long as I move.
</p>
