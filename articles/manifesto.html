<h1>Contradictionism Manifesto</h1>

<p>
Reality is not permanence. Identity is not a fixed core. Meaning is not inherited, but enacted. Life is a sequence of contradictions, and wisdom lies in holding them without collapsing into illusion or despair.
</p>

<p>
I reject rigid absolutes: truth may harm, lies may heal; selfishness may protect, kindness may destroy. Each choice exists in context, shaped by consequence, reflection, and ethical judgment.
</p>

<p>
I honor the unfinished. Perfection is a shadow; growth is a light. Suffering reveals, comfort sharpens, and balance teaches. To strive, to falter, and to continue is the essence of being.
</p>

<p>
I recognize that life is fleeting, cosmic significance uncertain, and legacy impermanent. Yet within this ephemeral stage, meaning blooms in the present, in ethical action, and in the courage to embrace contradiction.
</p>

<p>
To live fully is to accept the impossible coexistence of opposites, to act with awareness, and to remain perpetually in the act of becoming.
</p>

<p>
This is Contradictionism.
